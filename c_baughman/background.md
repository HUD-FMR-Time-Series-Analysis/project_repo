Relevant Federal Government Methodologies

The diverse agencies of the U.S Federal government have a multitude of different responsibilities that require measuring features of the American population over time. One of the most important general aspects of these measurements is to be able to consistently refer to places so that changes can be observed over time. In order to do this, both the Census Bureau and The Office of Management and Budget have established standardized ways to divide geographic areas that can then be used for 'apples-to-apples' measurements by various government (and often non-government) agencies. Let's take a brief look at the geographic designations that are relavant to this project. You can think of the three we use as three levels of zoom for city areas from seeing the city as a whole to seeing it in smaller pieces.

### Who's Where and What are They Doing?
Trying to describe all of the people in the United States over time in a meaningful, data-driven way is not an easy task. Putting people into defined groups and places into defined areas is a good place to start, but even the groups and places change over time. To help reduce the amount of that change, it is important to choose groups as areas that will remain as consistent as possible, but still provide useful, descriptive information. To do this, various Federal government agencies have created their own study methodologies to answer questions in their areas of responsibility. However, many of those areas overlap and there is need for policymakers to have consistent ways to talk about the people and places of the U.S. This seems to have lead to certain agencies establishing standards that are used across the government. In this study, we focus on policies and methodologies of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development

##### Core Based Statistical Areas
The OMB wanted a consistent way to aggregate statistics across the various jurisdictions that often make up metropolitan areas so they created the Core Based Statistical Area (CBSA) which are areas "containing a large population nucleus, or urban area, and adjacent communities that have a high degree of integration with that nucleus. There are two types of CBSAs: Metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) and micropolitan statistical areas (µSAs). Metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas are conceptually similar to each other, but a micropolitan area features a smaller nucleus.

Both metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas are composed of entire counties. “Central counties” are those that contain the population nucleus mentioned above. These nuclei are identified by a separate geographic statistical program, the urban areas program at the Census Bureau. “Outlying counties” qualify to join a central county based on demonstrating sufficient commuting with the central county or counties of the area. Counties that do not fall within metropolitan or micropolitan statistical areas are “outside of a CBSA.”"

#### Census Bureau Geographic Designations
The U.S. Census Bureau established a general heirarchy of geographic areas that could be thought of as nesting inside of one another. They have also established one other relavent measure that doesn't nest, but instead tries to connect census data to the USPS ZIP Codes we all know and love

##### ZIP Code Tabulation Areas
ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) are statistical entities developed by the United States Census Bureau for tabulating summary statistics. Though they are related to ZIP Codes the the U.S. Postal Service uses, they are not the same and should not be confused. "These were introduced with the Census 2000 and continued with the 2010 Census and 5 year American Community Survey[1] data sets. This new entity was developed to overcome the difficulties in precisely defining the land area covered by each ZIP code. Defining the extent of an area is necessary in order to tabulate census data for that area.

ZCTAs are generalized area representations of the United States Postal Service (USPS) ZIP code service areas, but are not the same as ZIP codes. Individual USPS ZIP codes can cross state, place, county, census tract, census block group and census block boundaries, so the Census Bureau asserts that "there is no correlation between ZIP codes and Census Bureau geography".[2] Moreover, the USPS frequently realigns, merges, or splits ZIP codes to meet changing needs. These changes are usually not reflected in the annual TIGER releases. Each ZCTA is constructed by aggregating the Census 2010 blocks whose addresses use a given ZIP code. In assembling census statistical units to create ZCTAs, the Census Bureau took the ZIP code used by the majority of addresses in each census unit at the time the data was compiled. As a result, some addresses end up with a ZCTA code that is different from their ZIP code. ZCTAs are not developed for ZIP codes that comprise only a small number of addresses.[3] Several ZCTAs represent ZIPs that no longer exist due to realignment by the USPS.

There are approximately 42,000 ZIP Codes and 32,000 ZCTAs. The reason that there is not one ZCTA for every ZIP Code is that only populated areas are included in the Census data, and thus ZIP Codes that only serve PO Boxes have no corresponding ZCTA.[4]" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_Code_Tabulation_Area


##### Census Tracts
Census tracts are the smallest entities relevant to this study. According to the U.S. Census Bureau,
"Census tracts are small, relatively permanent geographic entities within counties (or the statistical equivalents of counties) delineated by a com- mittee of local data users. Generally, census tracts have between 2,500 and 8,000 residents and boundaries that follow visible features. When first established, census tracts are to be as homogeneous as possible with res- pect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions." (https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/reference/GARM/Ch10GARM.pdf)

##### Census Blocks and Block Groups
"Census blocks, the smallest geographic area for which the Bureau of the Census collects and tabulates decennial census data, are formed
by streets, roads, railroads, streams and other bodies of water, other visible physical and cultural features, and the legal boundaries shown on Census Bureau maps. Census data for these areas serve as a valu- able source for small-area geographic studies. The Census Bureau has responded to public demand for more geographic coverage of census block data by expanding the Census Block Statistics Program each dec- ade since block data first were published in 1940. For the 1990 decen- nial census, the Census Bureau tabulated data by census block for the entire Nation, as well as Puerto Rico and the Outlying Areas (Ameri- can Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Palau, and the Virgin Islands of the United States). In 1990, the Census Bureau tabulated data for 7,020,924 census blocks.
Block groups (BGs) are the next level above census blocks in the geo- graphic hierarchy (see Figure 2-1 in Chapter 2). A BG is a combination of census blocks that is a subdivision of a census tract or block number- ing area (BNA). (A county or its statistically equivalent entity contains either census tracts or BNAs; it can not contain both.) A BG consists of all census blocks whose numbers begin with the same digit in a given census tract or BNA; for example, BG 3 includes all census blocks num- bered in the 300s. The BG is the smallest geographic entity for which the decennial census tabulates and publishes sample data. It has now largely replaced the earlier enumeration district (ED) as a small-area geographic unit for purposes of data presentation."
