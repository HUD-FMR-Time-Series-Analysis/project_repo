### Project Overview

Every year, the Department of Housing and Urban Development releases a list of Fair Market Rents for over 2,600 markets across the United States.
The HUD Fair Market Rent is calculated by taking into account features such as the size of the rental unit, the number of bedrooms, and the location of the property. FMR is used as the baseline for various government programs that provide housing assistance to low-income families, such as the Housing Choice Voucher Program and the Project-Based Voucher Program. As such, the accuracy of these values can't be overstated for the sake of the millions of Americans who depend on these programs. Our project's goal is to analyze the margin of error between HUD's FMR and 3rd party data for market averages to determine the reliability of FMR data in an actual market. If FMRs are too high, public housing agencies (PHAs) will be unable to maximize the number of families who receive assistance. If they're too low, it becomes more difficult for voucher users to acquire adequate housing.
